<!--this is the structure of a comment block in html files
        everything in this structure is not considered part of any
        content of your web page

        Most tag elements in html are done in apirs
        These are called opening and closing pairs
        The opening tag indicates the element is being requested
        The closing tag indicates the element is complete
        The closing tag has the same name as the opening tag PLUS
            a slash (/) preceeding the name

        Normally you will specify the language of the code on the web
        page using the lang element parameter to specify your coding lang-->

<head>
    <!--this is an element where you can code supports for the
            browser to use in interpreting the web page.
            the items within this element are NOT considered content.-->

    <h1> Basic HTML Tags - this is a h1 tag</h1>
    <h2> This is a h2 tag</h2>
    <h3> Paragraph tag - This is a h3 tag</h3>
    <!-- this is the coding block for your context in a paragraph tag
             a paragraph tag belongs to the "block" group of tags
             "block" group of tags places your content on a new line-->
    <p> The paragraph tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line in your displayed webpage on the browser.
        The browser does NOT display your content in the physical style of how you have entered your code in your HTML
        file.</p>
    <p>This is my second paragraph on the displayed browser page. It will start a new line.</p>
    <!--if you wish to use a component of a reserved tag (or the whole tag) you would be in trouble using the tag
                instead: you can use the special character strings to represent components of the tag such as the </less than (&lt;) and the >/greater than (&gt;)-->
    <h3>List tags: &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt;</h3>
    <!-- block tag
                 create an ordered list (numbered) using <ol> tag
                 create an unordered list (bulleted) using <ul> tag
                 items in the list are indicated using the <li> tag
                     -->

    <!-- this is an anchor tag and is incorrectly often referred to as the link tag
                One should NOT use the term link tag because there is actually a <link> tag used in the <head> section
                this tag can take you to a different location whether it be:
                 A different website
                 A different page in the current website 
                 A different position on the current page

                 href: points to the desired location
                 target: indicates the browser
                         default is same display page
                         _blank will open a new browser tab-->
    <a href="https://www.nait.ca" target="_blank">Go to Nait.ca</a>
